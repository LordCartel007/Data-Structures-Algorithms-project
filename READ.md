Names of the data structures & Reasons

(A) Linked List :
Reason: They are specialized data structures used in databases and file systems for efficient indexing and are more complex than simpler trees like binary search trees. Mastery requires understanding their balance and node management in depth.

(B) Hash Tree
Reason for Not Mastering: Hash trees are complex data structures often used in specialized fields like cryptographic applications and blockchain technology. Mastery requires understanding their specific use cases, such as data integrity verification and efficient proof generation, which might not be common in everyday programming tasks.

(C)Graph Structure
Reason for Not Mastering: Graph structures are fundamental and highly versatile, but mastering them involves a wide range of algorithms and techniques for various types of graphs (e.g., directed, undirected, weighted). The complexity and breadth of topics, including graph traversal and shortest path algorithms, can be overwhelming, leading to a gradual learning process.

(D) Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
Reason for Not Mastering: Fenwick trees are efficient for cumulative frequency tables and range queries, but their implementation and use cases are less common than other data structures like arrays or linked lists. Mastery requires specific scenarios where Fenwick trees excel, which might not frequently appear in general programming problems.

(E) Union-Find Data Structure
Reason for Not Mastering: The Union-Find data structure, used for managing disjoint sets and solving connectivity problems, involves concepts like path compression and union by rank. Its advanced techniques and applications, such as in network connectivity and certain graph algorithms, might not be encountered often outside of specialized problems or competitive programming.

(F) Cycle Finding in Graphs
Reason for Not Mastering: Detecting cycles in graphs involves algorithms that vary based on whether the graph is directed or undirected. While essential, mastering cycle detection requires understanding different approaches and their complexities, which can be challenging given the various methods and their specific use cases.

(G) Geometry Algorithms
Reason for Not Mastering: Geometry algorithms, including those for convex hulls, line intersections, and point-in-polygon problems, are crucial in computational geometry. However, their applications are often domain-specific, such as in graphics or geographical information systems, making them less familiar if one does not regularly work in these areas.
